# Instructions for Generating the Project Report PDF

## Option 1: Using the Python Script (Recommended)

1. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install markdown pdfkit
   ```

2. Download and install wkhtmltopdf from: https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html
   This is required for the PDF conversion.

3. After installing wkhtmltopdf, run the Python script:
   ```
   python convert_to_pdf.py
   ```

4. This will generate two files:
   - `project_report.html` - An intermediate HTML file
   - `ISCP_Project_Report.pdf` - The final PDF report

## Option 2: Manual Conversion

If you encounter issues with the Python script, you can use online tools:

1. Open the `project_report.md` file in a text editor
2. Copy all the content
3. Use an online Markdown to PDF converter like:
   - https://www.markdowntopdf.com/
   - https://md2pdf.netlify.app/
   - https://dillinger.io/ (Export as PDF)

4. Download the generated PDF

## Option 3: Use a Markdown Editor

1. Open the `project_report.md` file with a Markdown editor that supports PDF export:
   - Typora (https://typora.io/) - Has built-in PDF export
   - VS Code with Markdown PDF extension

2. Use the editor's export feature to create a PDF
